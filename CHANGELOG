pykpass version 0.5
Changed method of disabling the MIT Kerberos replay cache. The old
method set a flag in krb5_auth_con_setflags(), which does not appear
to work correctly in newer versions of MIT krb5. The new method
sets the environment variable KRB5RCACHETYPE to "none" - this needs
MIT Kerberos 1.4.x or newer to work. For earlier versions the replay
cache won't be disabled.
